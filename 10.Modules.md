## 1. Problem: All Code in One File

* In small examples, we often put everything in `main.ts`.
* But **real-world apps** may have **hundreds of files**.
* Keeping everything in one file quickly becomes **messy and hard to manage**.

---

## 2. Solution: Modules

* In TypeScript, **each file is a module**.
* A module encapsulates code and can **export** parts of it for use in other files.
* Anything **not exported** stays private to that file.

---

## 3. Example: Creating a Module

We define our `Point` class in `point.ts`.

```ts
export class Point {
    constructor(private _x?: number, private _y?: number) {}

    draw() {
        console.log(`Drawing point at (${this._x}, ${this._y})`);
    }
}
```

* Adding the `export` keyword makes `Point` **accessible outside** this file.

---

## 4. Importing a Module

Now in `main.ts` we can import and use it:

```ts
import { Point } from './point';

let point = new Point(1, 2);
point.draw();
```

### notes:

> `./point` → refers to the file `point.ts` in the same folder.
> 
> We do **not** include the `.ts` extension — just the module name (`point`).

---

## 5. Module Paths

* `./` → current folder
* `../` → parent folder
