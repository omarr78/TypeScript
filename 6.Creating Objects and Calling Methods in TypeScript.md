```ts

class Point {

    x: number;
    y: number;

    draw() {
        console.log("Drawing point at (" + this.x + ", " + this.y + ")");
    }

    getDistance(another: Point) : number {
        const dx = this.x - another.x;
        const dy = this.y - another.y;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
}
```

## 1. Declaring a Variable of a Custom Type

```ts
let point: Point;
point.draw();
```

> Problem: Runtime error â†’ `Cannot read property 'draw' of undefined`

Why?

* `point` is only **declared**, not **initialized**.
* Unlike primitive types (number, string, boolean), custom objects need **explicit memory allocation**.

---

## 2. Initializing an Object with `new`

```ts
let point: Point = new Point();
```

### Here:

* `new Point()` creates a new object in memory.
* `point` now references a valid `Point` object.

---

## 3. Type Inference (Cleaner Code)

Since TypeScript can **infer the type** from the assignment, we can drop the type annotation:

```ts
let point = new Point();
point.draw();
```

Now `point` is automatically recognized as a `Point` object.

---

## 4. Default Values of Properties

If we run this code now:

```ts
let point = new Point();
point.draw();
```

Output:

* `x` and `y` are `undefined` (because no values were assigned).

---

## 5. Assigning Property Values

We can fix this by assigning values manually:

```ts
let point = new Point();
point.x = 1;
point.y = 2;
point.draw();
```

Output:

```
Drawing point at (1, 2)
```

---

## 6. Using `getDistance` Method

If our class also has a `getDistance` method:

```ts
class Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;

    draw() {
        console.log(`Drawing point at (${this.x}, ${this.y})`);
    }

    getDistance(another: Point) {
        let dx = this.x - another.x;
        let dy = this.y - another.y;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
}
```

We can create two objects and use both methods:

```ts
let p1 = new Point();
p1.x = 1;
p1.y = 2;

let p2 = new Point();
p2.x = 4;
p2.y = 6;

p1.draw();
console.log("Distance:", p1.getDistance(p2));
```

Output:

```
Drawing point at (1, 2)
Distance: 5
```
