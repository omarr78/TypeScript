### Overview

* **TypeScript is not a completely new language** - Itâ€™s a **superset** of JavaScript.
  * Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

* But typescript has additional features that do not exist in JavaScript

## For example

### 1. Strong Typing (Static Typing)

* TypeScript introduces optional static typing.
* In languages like **C#** or **Java**, variables must have defined types.
* In TypeScript, typing is optional but highly recommended:

  * Improves **predictability**
  * Easier to **debug** and **maintain**
  * Reduces runtime errors

---

### 2. Object-Oriented Features

TypeScript adds missing OOP features to JavaScript, including:

* **Classes & Interfaces**
* **Constructors**
* **Access Modifiers** (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
* **Properties & Methods**
* **Generics**

---

### 3. Catch Errors at Compile-Time

* Many errors are detected **before runtime** during compilation.
* This allows developers to **fix issues early** before deploying.
* Not all errors can be caught, but it greatly reduces runtime crashes.

---

### 4. Enhanced Tooling & Editor Support

* TypeScript improves developer experience with:

  * **Intelligent code completion (IntelliSense)**
  * **Refactoring support**
  * **Better navigation (go to definition, find references, etc.)**

---

### Compilation to JavaScript

* Browsers **do not understand TypeScript directly**.
* TypeScript code is **transpiled** (compiled) into plain JavaScript.
* The resulting JavaScript is what actually runs in the browser.
